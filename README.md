# Surfs_up

## Project Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to utilize SQLAlchemy, a query tool designed for use with SQLite, to analyze the weather data on Oahu Island. We also used flask to share the data, FLASK is a web framework which could be used to share our analysis and data in real time.

## Resources

-Data Source: hawaii.sqlite, SurfsUp_Challenge_starter_code.ipynb

-Software: Python 3.7.10, Visual Studio Code

## Purpos

The purpose of this analysis was to analyze the temperature trends for the months of June and December in Oahu to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business would be sustainable year-round. This analysis saw the data being imported via SQLAlchemy and queried using the “create engine” function. The imported data was converted into a data frame and filtered by month, and the summary statistics for the months of June and December produced using the “describe function”.

@@ Summary

From the results we can conclude that the temperatures for June and December are relatively comparable and would be suitable for surfing all year long. There is not much difference in highest temperature for moth months , altough the lowest temperature recorded in december is 56 F which is not bad for surfing. With the data pf extreme months , it seems that the project “Surf ‘n’ Shake” is a viable investment.
